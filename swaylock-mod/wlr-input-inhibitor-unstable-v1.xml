      While this resource exists, input to clients other than the owner of the
      inhibitor resource will not receive input events. The client that owns
      this resource will receive all input events normally. The compositor will
      also disable all of its own input processing (such as keyboard shortcuts)
      while the inhibitor is active.

      The compositor may continue to send input events to selected clients,
      such as an on-screen keyboard (via the input-method protocol).
